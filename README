1. PENNIES ON GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE



	First and foremost, as a disclaimer I would like to note that I carried through this question with the thought of using the 
dimensions of the Golden Gate Bridge [GGB] but upon a flat plane. Before assessing the question, I of course need the dimensions 
of both the Golden Gate and a Penny. 

	thanks to goldengatebridge.org/research/factsGGBDesign.php, I have found that the GGB's total width is 90Ft or 27m; and
that the total length [from abutment to abutment] is 8,981ft or 2,737m. a random google search returned to me that a penny has a
diameter of .75in or 19mm.

	From here, in my perfect world where I seem to be correct, I see an easy correlation between this problem and a simple 
multiplication equation. Moreover, a question that might be reminiscent of a "Find the area of a rectangle/square." Now supposing 
i am going in the correct direction, the next thing to do is treat the dimensions of the Golden Gate as a usual Length and Width; 
next I decided to find how many pennies would line along the perimeter, more importantly how many pennies lie along one of
the longer sides and one of the shorter sides ... so what do I do? thats right kids, time for MATH!

	But wait young and confused engineering hopeful! you have conversions and different measuring systems beyond that.
Well, I at first thought to do the work for both, but ran into some trouble [discrepancies in amount]. But since I love you IGN, I
will continue as planned at the cost of looking dumb [as i probably already do].


First, the math in METERS ... 
[Conversion: 1000mm is equal to 1m]

Width
GGB Width = 27m
A Penny's Diameter = 19mm

What I did here was first convert the Golden Gate's width from meters into milimeters by multiplying the width by 1000, then taking
the product and dividing it by the penny's diameter ... praying that the answer of that brought me the number a pennies needed for
later step ...

27 * 1000 = 27000
27000 / 19 = 1,421


I shall need 1,421 after i complete the next [but same] step for the ... 

Length
GGB Length = 2,737
A Penny's Diameter = 19mm

I use the same method of calculations here

2,737 * 1000 = 2,737,000
2,737,000 / 19 = 144,052


Now I multiply the number I got for the width and the number I got for the length


1,421 * 144,052 = 204,697,892 [roughly about]



So if my line of thinking is correctand i use the metric measurements it would take around 204,697,892 pennies to fill the Golden Gate.


using FEET ... ?
[Conversion: 1Ft is equal to 12in]

Width
90 * 12 = 1080
1080 / .75 = 1,440

Length
8,981 * 12 = 107,772
107,772 / .75 = 143,696


1,440 * 143,696 = 206,922,240 [Roughly about] 

If i use feet then my calculations return an amount of 206,922,240 Pennies fitting on the Golden Gate without overlapping.















2. Three Picture sizes with a 16:9Aspect Ratio



	Truth be told, I am not as well versed in aspect ratios and the such. However prior to submitting this, i spent quite an 
amount of time studying and researching the topic. Amongst my findings, I found the more commonly used 16:9 dimensions ...

1024 x 576	which had a factor of 64
1280 x 720	which had a factor of 80
1600 x 900	which had a factor of 100
1920 x 1080	which had a factor of 120
2560 x 1440	which had a factor of 160
3840 x 2160	which had a factor of 240

	From there with hopes to learn of something that might be of more use to me, I visted to IGN.com! No i'm not making kissy face,
but i did look at certain pictures you guys had posted on the site and found an Erica Ocampo [kissy face there] picture with a dimension
set of 1024 x 685, but when performing the same mathematical opperation instead of a common factor, i reached a 64 x 76.1 reading.
Tried another, 323 x 482 = 20.2 x 53.6 ... then i thought "maybe if i switch the values" ... so in other words: 482 x 323 = 30.1 x 38.9.

	Now seeing as how i am unsure and drawing a slight blank, only thing left to do is make educated guesses at the sizes using 
math ...

My "answers" were arrived by taking 1920 x 1080 with a factor of 120 [seeing as how there are 12in wide increments] and adding values 
of 12 or values divisible by 12 ...

2304 x 1296
1344 x 756
2112 x 1188

... ... ... ?















3. Knight on a Chessboard

	Thanks to an episode of Batman: The Animated Series, it was revealed to me once that a knight can cover an entire chessboard
in sixty-four turns [the same amount as the number of squares] without touching any square a repeating time.


My "CODE"




*First state Variables

Int_Num_of_Turns as Integer
Int_Num_of_Spaces_Covered as Integer

Int_Num_of_Turns = 1
Int_Num_of_Spaces_Covered = 1

Do
   * Barring in mind the rules and restrictions of moving a knight while playing chess, proceed with moving knight for turn

   Int_Num_of_Turns += 1

   * Let's assume for the sake of the argument, that spaces covered once are unavailable afterwards

   If "knight.Location = Changed" Then
      Int_Num_of_Spaces_Covered += 1
   Else
      End Program.
   End If

Until Int_Num_of_Spaces_Covered = 64

If Int_Num_of_Spaces_Covered = Int_Num_of_Turns Then
   Display("The minimum amount of moves it takes to move a knight around a chessboard, is " & Int_num_of_Turns.ToString & ".")
Else
   Display("I have failed you IGN D=")

END PROGRAM






	Regarding the Graph, as i will send as an attachment enclosed in the email concealing the link to the repository ...
seeing as how it is a one-to-one move set if executed correctly, it should come accross as a linear graph starting at the origin
(0, 0) and rising with a slope of 1, ascending to the top right corner.

















4. Why do you need IGN and why does IGN need you?

	Before I end this journey of growth, i would love to thank you from the bottom of my heart IGN. I read articles on ign.com
every monday-friday as it is my first website of the day unless something is of more dire immediacy. And more thanks for welcoming 
me into the office for the June 3rd IGN FIRST FRIDAY Tour. 

	I feel that i need IGN because being a budding Computer ENgineer who loves gaming, movies, gear and who can forget babes,
I would be in a position that only has room for success. to learn coding from IGN who happens to usually be my first source of 
information [in certain cases] anyway would be the dream opportunity for me. Engineering aside, IGN sets the stage for creativity to
flow endlessly. and according to compliments from others [trying to avoid being arogant here] I tend to be a creative person, as well
as critical thinker, if properly educated ... in other words, one could say IGN could help me obtain a better ME while working for a 
company I have already been a fan of for years. Plus one could take such vital information IGN has to teach and utilize it for years
and opportunities to come.

	On the other hand, IGN could possibly benefit from having me on board. I am bred for collaborative work being one who performed
in Concert Band & Drumline, providing a portion aiding to the overall product, maybe the musician in me but blending in where needed is a 
trait i'm used to letting take its course. Furthermore, the "mArketability" sky rockets for I have a past in art [went to Academy of Art in 2004
for photography/Photoshope & Comic Book Design], I Have been praised for my writting ability [do not ask me why], I am an avid learner meaning
learning is something i do find fun. I love learning languages [computer and spoken], I am "Self Taught" when it comes to playing the Piano
and guitar ... so any lessons i could pick up while at IGN would be a pleasurable experience as opposed to a chore or an obsticle in the way
of getting a pay check. 

	As i told an editor while on my tour of the IGN studios, I'd do anything to work at IGN even be a doorman yelling out
"ACCESS DENIED!" but as I was soon to leave Code-Foo was brought to my attention and it was highly suggested by Jennie Fissel that i submit
an entry. Figuring i'd do something with my life, thought it'd be awesome to at least try to get it. And Regardless of the result I am extremely
grateful for the chance to learn from the great people at IGN. Thank You, and God Bless
